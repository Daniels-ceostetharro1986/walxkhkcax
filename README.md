Wow, just finished It Feeds and honestly, I'm still buzzing. Like what even was that ending?? ðŸ˜‚ You ever watch something and you're just left sitting there like, What did I just see? Because yep, that's me right now. I swear, the writers were either geniuses or totally lost. Maybe both.

The whole vibe of the movie had me hooked from the start. The pacing was wild, like sometimes way too slow and then suddenly all up in your face. And that twist with the guy in the mask - who saw that coming? I definitely didn't. I mean, I was literally stress-eating popcorn the entire time, trying to guess who the real villain was. But then plot twist after plot twist, my brain was like, Nope, can't keep up.

> Oh, and don't even get me started on that soundtrack! Where do they find all those creepy yet somehow catchy tunes? I kinda wanna download the movie just to listen to it all over again. ðŸ˜‚ Is that weird? Screw it, I'm blaming it on the lack of sleep.

I gotta say, some characters were cool but others seriously got on my nerves. Like Steven. Why did he always show up with that smug look? I was like, Bro, you're not as smart as you think. But then, he kinda redeemed himself at the end, so props to him, I guess. I need to watch the movie again just to catch all the subtle stuff I clearly missed. You know, those sneaky little clues they hide everywhere.

Some of the dialogue was hilarious. Unintentionally, I think? But it added to the whole chaotic feel. Couldnâ€™t decide if I should laugh or cringe every time Marie and her best friend argued about ghosts. Those two! Like they needed serious help understanding sarcasm or reality... or both.

if(val == confused){ status = still confused; }

But yeah, overall, Iâ€™m glad I watched it. Totally worth the late night even if it means Iâ€™ll probably be a zombie tomorrow. Anyway, let me know what you thought when you catch it. We gotta dissect this movie together! ðŸ˜„
